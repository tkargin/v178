title: Thompson Sampling Achieves $\tilde O(\sqrt T)$ Regret in Linear Quadratic Control
abstract: Thompson Sampling (TS) is an efficient method for decision-making under
  uncertainty, where an action is sampled from a carefully prescribed distribution
  which is updated based on the observed data. In this work, we study the problem
  of adaptive control of stabilizable linear-quadratic regulators (LQRs) using TS,
  where the system dynamics are unknown. Previous works have established that $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$
  frequentist regret is optimal for the adaptive control of LQRs. However, the existing
  methods either work only in restrictive settings, require a priori known stabilizing
  controllers or utilize computationally intractable approaches. We propose an efficient
  TS algorithm for the adaptive control of LQRs, TS-based Adaptive Control, TSAC,
  that attains $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, even for multidimensional systems, thereby
  solving the open problem posed in \citet{abeille2018improved}. TSAC does not require
  a priori known stabilizing controller and achieves fast stabilization of the underlying
  system by effectively exploring the environment in the early stages. Our result
  hinges on developing a novel lower bound on the probability that the TS provides
  an optimistic sample. By carefully prescribing an early exploration strategy and
  a policy update rule, we show that TS achieves order-optimal regret in adaptive
  control of multidimensional stabilizable LQRs. We empirically demonstrate the performance
  and the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in several adaptive control tasks.
